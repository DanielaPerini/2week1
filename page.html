    <h1>The importance of Responsive Design</h1>
    <p>Have you ever been using your phone, searching for something and found a website that was just what you were looking for at that moment but when you touch the link to open it it looks like it was not well made for your screen size? It does not look/work as well as it does in a bigger screen (like in a computer), does it? 
    </p>
    <p>Nowadays with so many different screen sizes and different smartphones in the market it is impossible to develop a different website for each of them and that is what makes Responsive Design so awesome!    
    </p>
    <p>Studies show that over half of all web traffic comes from mobile devices, most of the time that adults spend in the internet is using mobile devices and not computers and about 80% of the people who has internet connection owns a smartphone as well. We also learn that more than half of the internet users would not recomment a company that has a site that does not work well in mobile devices.
    </p>
    <p>You want your clients to see your brand as serious and reliable. That is exactly why websites should always be responsive. You must make your site be pleasant for users to look and navigate at. If you want your company to atract clients and to be successful it will be worth it spending a little more time thinking about how you can make your website look good in every screen.
